Once upon a time, there was a programmer who tried to replace their personal Ruby-based blog with JavaScript.
He failed miserably. The end.

Jokes aside, this project came from a brief exploration with the static site generator [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/). Although, after playing around a bit, I decided to stick with what I was already using previously, I am keeping this code here for any future need or reference, mine or anyone else's on the same endeavor.
